This coursework implements forward and inverse kinematics, trajectory generation, and collision-aware control of a 4-DOF robotic arm. Using MATLAB and the Robotics Toolbox, the robot autonomously navigates a simulated library to retrieve and shelve books with precision. The project emphasizes analytical IK solutions, optimized grasping strategies, and fluid animation control.

ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
Model the robot arm using Denavitâ€“Hartenberg parameters and verify with a custom URDF.

- Solve inverse kinematics analytically to reach book positions and place them on designated shelves.
- Integrate collision objects and simulate real-time book grasping using prismatic joints.
- Generate realistic trajectories using point-to-point and cosine-interpolation methods.
- Build full robot animations for book pickup and placement including intermediate reorientation steps.
